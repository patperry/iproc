           INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create the csrch directory structure with
       gzip -d csrch.tar.gz
       tar -xvf csrch.f
   This produces the directory csrch and the
   subdirectory source.

2. Change directories to csrch and install csrch with 
       make install
   This creates libraries in each of the subdirectories

3. Create the executable csrch.x with 
       make csrch 
   and run the sample problems by executing csrch

4. Compare the output in csrch.out with the output in csrch.sun4
